rlibrary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
rlibrary is an educational project of mine to create a cross-platform I/O
class library in C++. rlibrary draws a lot of its design on both the C and C++
standard libraries. The library also provides data structures and useful
utility functions.

rlibrary is currently in an unfinished but workable state. Again, this project
merely started out as an education project of mine. The library isn't designed
to be used for production though I do target it in several of my other projects.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things the library currently supports:
       generic IO device library
       generic IO stream library
       standard IO device and stream library
       file IO device and stream library (partially finished)
       string data type
       filename parsing library
       primitive exception typing
       several core data structures
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things the library is going to, but does not currently support:
       pipes
       consoles
       threading
       sockets
       process management
       process environment modification
       several core data structures haven't been added yet
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Building rlibrary - to build the library for POSIX platforms, run GNU Make on
the project makefile. To build it for Win32 platforms, run the MSBuild script.

Both scripts should produce a static library against which programs can be
linked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the headers - installing the headers in a system directory is recommended.
The makefile also comes with a standard 'install' rule that copies them to the
local header include directory on Linux boxes.

Every (mostly) rlibrary name is a member of namespace 'rtypes'.
