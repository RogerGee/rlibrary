Console Capabilities:
        -> clear screen
           (this is the console's native way to clear the screen)
        -> colors
           -> get/set fore/back-ground color information for cursor location
           -> apply color information to back buffer           
        -> bell char
        -> cursor
           -> set position
           -> get position
        -> window
           (some consoles resize their buffers automatically [like xterm] whereas others
            such as ConHost.exe on Windows maintain a fixed buffer size and have a current
            window size [view]. Therefore, this library is not concerned with the absolute
            size of the window, merely the users current view of the console.
           -> get current screen dimensions
           -> set screen dimensions
           -> event handling for window size change
           -> set/get window title
        -> echo input mode on|off
        -> canonical vs. non-canonical mode
        -> cursor settings
           adjust size OR turn off blinking OR disable completely

Terminfo:
        Systems which implement terminals and puesdo-terminals (POSIX systems) use terminfo to describe
the capabilities of a terminal. RLibrary implements terminfo by reading in ncurses-complient compiled
binary terminfo databases. Rlibrary makes several critical assumptions based on the documentation for
ncurses:
        1. the compiled database file name is exported in the TERM environment variable
        2. the compiled database file is located in one of the following locations, stored
        in a subdirectory that uses the directory tree /parent/a, where 'a' is the starting
        letter of the term name:
               (these are searched in this order)
               -> /lib/terminfo/
               -> /etc/terminfo/
               -> /usr/share/terminfo/
               -> ~/.terminfo/
               (if the TERMINFO environment variable is defined, then the search paths in
               its value are searched as well)
        4. the compiled format is binary compatible with the ncurses specification; since compiled
        terminfo databases do not contain metadata which would identify the index of the entry in a 
        certain section, rlibrary assumes that the order is consistent with the documentation for 
        ncurses, specifically the order of the capabilities from the file include/Caps.
